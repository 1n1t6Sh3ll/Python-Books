# 👁️ Computer Vision

Teach computers to see and understand images.

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

### 1. Image Fundamentals
- Image representation (pixels, channels)
- Image preprocessing
- Data augmentation
- OpenCV basics

### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks
- Convolution and pooling layers
- CNN architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG)
- Modern architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models

### 3. Object Detection
- R-CNN family
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- SSD (Single Shot Detector)
- Evaluation: mAP, IoU

### 4. Advanced Topics
- Image segmentation (U-Net, Mask R-CNN)
- Generative models (GANs, Stable Diffusion)
- Video analysis
- 3D vision
